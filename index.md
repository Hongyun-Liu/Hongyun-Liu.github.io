From May 22 to 28, 2025, we were delighted to welcome
[**Prof. Yang Liu**](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~yliu87/) from the University
of Maryland for a fantastic series of lectures on
**Bayesian statistical methods**.
Current students and alumni from **[Prof. Hongyun Liu](https://psych.bnu.edu.cn/szdw/zrjs/js/lhy/index.htm)â€™s and
[Prof. Yueqin Hu](https://github.com/yueqinhu)â€™s** research groups came together
for the sessions, engaging in lively discussions and shared learning. It was a
great week full of insights, questions, and collaborative spirit!
**Huge thanks to Prof. Liu for the inspiring lectures, and to everyone who
participated with such enthusiasm**. Looking forward to more academic events like
this in the future!

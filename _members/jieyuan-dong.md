Hi, I'm Jieyuan DONG (董洁源), an Academic Master's student in Psychological Statistics and Psychometrics, Beijing Normal University (BNU).

My research focuses on **Bayesian latent variable models**, particularly those within the framework of **item response theory**. I investigate methods for controlling response biases—such as *careless/insufficient effort responding* and *response styles*—in self-report measures, and I am currently also interested in *intensive longitudinal data analysis*.

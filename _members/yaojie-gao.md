Hi, I'm Yaojie Gao(高垚杰), and I will be starting my Academic Master's degree in September 2025 at Beijing Normal University (BNU), specializing in Psychological Statistics and Psychometrics.

I have studied **Computerized Adaptive Testing** and am very interested in applying natural language processing techniques to psychological research methods. Currently, my research mainly focuses on using Large Language Models for **Automatic Item Generation** to build item banks for adaptive testing.

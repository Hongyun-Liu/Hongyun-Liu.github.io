Hi! I’m Minglan Li (李明澜) 👋
I’m a Ph.D. student in Psychological Statistics and Psychometrics at Beijing Normal University 🌍✨.

My research focuses on applying machine learning methods in psychological research 🤖🧪. I’m especially interested in using surrogate models to improve the efficiency of power analysis, as well as exploring the uncertainty in power estimation across complex modeling scenarios💡💻.

Hi! I'm Junpeng Zhang (张俊鹏). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Psychology at Beijing Normal University between 2018 and 2022. Following this, I pursued a Master's degree in Economics (Econometrics) at the Paris School of Economics. I am currently a Research Assistant in the DyMAP Lab.

My research interests lie in applying machine learning and other modeling methods to educational, social, and clinical psychology. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested!
